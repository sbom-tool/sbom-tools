//! ML-based embedding matching (requires `ml-matching` feature).
//!
//! This module provides neural network-based component matching using
//! text embeddings. It requires the `candle-core` dependency.

// This is a stub file that will be populated when the ml-matching feature is implemented.
// For now, it exists to allow cargo fmt to work correctly.
